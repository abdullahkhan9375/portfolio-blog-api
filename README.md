# portfolio-blog-api
A simple API that will be consumed by a NextJs front-end. My first attempt at a Golang project!

## Major Features
### Docker Container support.
- I have added a docker file to make sure that the app can be dockerized and deployed. I will be updating this periodically as I explore cloud services best fitted
for this minimalistic API.

## Simple JSON based response structure.
- As of 08/17/2022, this API is not hooked up to a backend so currently just serving local JSON objects that contain information for my portfolio website. I am
looking to add a database connection and use this API as a monolithic controller.
